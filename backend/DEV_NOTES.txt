######   Installing tymon-jwt-auth  #########

TUTORIAL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvrTlxfd3DU

Let's learn how to install and configure tymon/jwt-auth.
The installation process is pretty simple, but, as the tymon/jwt-auth library is in constant development, we should take some care related what the version we will use:

Open the project/composer.json file and add the following line of code, right after Laravel/Tinker:
"tymon/jwt-auth": "1.0.*"

Run:

composer update 


Now, it is time to publish the vendor package. Still in your Terminal window and inside the Tinker console, type the following command:

php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"


Note that we are using Laravel 5.6 and jwt-auth 1.0, so we don't need to perform any additional actions to load JWT providers. The jwt-auth documents sometimes look like a mess and are very confusing, but don't worry, just follow our steps and you will be safe from mismatching documentation.
Let's generate the secret. Still in the Terminal window, type the following command:

 php artisan jwt:secret


The previous command will generate a secret key on your .env file, and will look something like the following line:
JWT_SECRET=McR1It4Bw9G8jU1b4XJhDMeZs4Q5Zwear
At this point, we have successfully installed jwt-auth, but we need to take some more steps to make our API secure.
